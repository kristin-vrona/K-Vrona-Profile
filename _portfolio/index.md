Kristin Vrona, "Mental Health and Absenteeism: the Role of Fringe Benefits as Moderators”

This paper analyzes the effect of mental illness on absenteeism for employed adults utilizing
data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for years 2010 to 2014. Empirically, I
estimate the effect of diagnosed mental illness on absenteeism while conditioning on heterogenous
degrees of symptom severity and utilize a rich set control variables to account for many other
sources of heterogeneity at the individual, family, regional, and macro-economic level. I also
analyze how various job factors may either enhance or relieve some of the impact of mental
illness on annual days absent from work. Results suggest that fringe benefits that encourage a
substitution of labor time for time spent on health results in greater absenteeism; however, there
is also evidence that this type of benefit acts as a mitigator to the magnitude of the impact
of mental illness on absenteeism, supporting the hypothesis that benefit packages that promote
worker wellness improve productive outcomes of employees.

Results suggest that fringe benefits mitigating the cost of losing a day of work in the interest of rebuilding health stock results in greater absenteeism at face value. However, there is also evidence that this type of benefit acts as a mitigator to the magnitude of the impact of mental illness on absenteeism across time, supporting the hypothesis that benefit packages that promote worker wellness is an investment that improves productive outcomes of employees and reduced turnover over time.

Kristin Vrona, “Mental Health and Employment Duration”
Using duration analysis and a building a latent model of health demand, this analysis pieces apart how
mental health in particular impacts one’s labor market outcomes in the form of employment
duration as well as durations of lay offs that result in long term unemployment.
