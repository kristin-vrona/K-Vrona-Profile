# Welcome​

<img src="https://github.com/kvrona/K-Vrona-Profile/blob/master/assets/images/vkheadshotnov.png?raw=true" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

My name is Kristin Vrona and I am a current current Ph.D. candidate at Northern Illinois University, specializing in health economics, labor economics, and applied econometrics.

I hold a master's degree in economics and have experience applying these skills in business and public sector positions.

I am currently on the job market and available for interviews. 



### Background
Born and raised in Illinois, I’m a proud Northern Illinois University (NIU) loyalist, earning my B.S. in Economics summa cum laude, followed by my M.A. and ongoing Ph.D. in Economics, with a focus on health economics and econometrics.

My career began as a Business Analyst at M.O.L. America Inc., where I enhanced forecasting models for quantity movements and costs, achieving an 8% improvement within three months by implementing econometric methods. My model gained recognition and became the company standard within my first year. 

As a Graduate Fellow at NIU’s Institute for the Study of the Environment, Sustainability, and Energy, I partnered with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) to refine funding allocations for community projects. Our work centered on making the scoring process more equitable, ensuring that resources reached communities most in need, including those facing critical safety issues, like inadequate transportation or playgrounds in disrepair. Through this collaboration, I advocated for funding to address urgent infrastructure gaps rather than supporting only new, high-profile projects.

In my free time, I enjoy writing and recording music with my husband and spending time outdoors.
