Welcome to my page.

I am a Master of Economics and current Ph.D. candidate at Northern Illinois University, specializing in Econometrics, Health Economics, and Labor Economics. 

I am currently on the job market and available for interviews. 




### Background
My doctoral research focuses on the causal impact of mental health on  labor market productivity outcomes and how workplace factors, benefits, and overall additudes about reciving healthcare influence this impact. 

Born and raised in Illinois, I’m a proud NIU loyalist, having earned all my degrees from the university, first obtaining a B.S. in Economics with highest honors. My first post-B.S. job was a Business Analyst role at an international logistics company, where I took initiative and implemented innovations that exceeded expectations within my first year.

Data Analysis & Econometrics: Expertise in re-sampling techniques, matching methods, simulation methods, survival & hazard analysis, bias reduction methods, limited dependent variable models, panel & time-series methods.

Technical Proficiency: Expert in R, SAS, and proficient in Microsoft Office with VBA (Excel automation).

Communication & Management: Skilled in report generation, budget tracking, time management, and coordinating deliverables.

Applied Economics: Experienced in logistics, public funds management, and leveraging applied theory to inform empirical practice.


In my free time, I enjoy writing and recording music with my husband and spending time outdoors. 

I consider myself a welfare economist above all and am eager to apply my expertise to organizations committed to improving social welfare and driving innovation.
